On this website, you will get to know more about me by learning about a few of my different interests and passion. I have listed pages that are about traveling, food, and music because each of these elements represents an aspect of who I am. I hope to continue to develop as a person and gain more interests and passions as I am an upperclassman. In the future, I will continue to grow and develop this website as way for others to more publically get to know me and network. I hope you enjoy! </th>
