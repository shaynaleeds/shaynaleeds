      <h1>Where to eat?</h1>
      <p> Food is a part of everyone's life whether you like it or not. I gain joy everytime I have the opportunity to try a new type of food or get to go to a new restaurant. One of the many benefits of attending UW Madison is their vast array of cuisine. Whehter you are looking for Mexican, Asian, Thai, American or any other type of food we have it here. Below are some of my favorite places to eat on campus. I have also included photos of some of my favorite dished I was able to try this summer:</p>
      <dl>
         <dt> Ian's</dt>
         <dd>This is a staple if you attend UW Madison. I would recommend getting their Mac N' Cheese slice because that is what they are best known for. </dd>
         <dt> Eno Vino</dt>
         <dd>If you are wanting good food with an unreal view of the capital, this is the place for you. This upscale restaurant will not dissapoint.</dd> 
         <dt> Memorial Union</dt>
         <dd>Another top place for students whether looking for food, a study space, or even an incredible sunset. </dd> 
         <dt> Forage</dt>
         <dd>This is the place I go when wanting something quick and easy. This is by far the best place if you are looking for something refreshing and wanting a break from the cheese curds</dd>
